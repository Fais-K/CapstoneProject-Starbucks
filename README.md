# Personalized Marketing - Starbucks
## Objective
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer and determines the level of response or the user actions like offer received, offer viewed, transaction, offer completed etc based on the demographic attributes of the customer and other offer attributes of Starbucks; which can be used to discover the ways to elevate the future customer response. This model is to be trained and tested using the XGBoost machine learning framework on the Starbucks dataset that contains simulated data that mimics customer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. We may compare the same model with the DNN benchmark models built on the same dataset.
## Installations
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras, XGBoost, Imblearn.
## Acknowledgement
The dataset that we've used for this project is from Starbucks, which has been made open for Udacity scholars to analyse and build machine learning projects, as a part of earning their Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.
